		<h2>About Ihop</h2>
		<p> Since 1958, IHOPÃ‚Â® has been the place where people connect over breakfast, enjoy study breaks, grab a bite before or after sporting events, and so much more. And no matter what menu items they order, there is one ingredient that is always constant Ã¢â‚¬â€ a smile. We have seen millions of smiles over the years in ihop restaurants, and now shared in photos across our social properties. In fact, smiles are so much a part of our culture that we changed our logo to include one.


		<p>This is just one of the many fun and exciting changes you can expect from IHOPÃ‚Â®. Because we know the shortest distance between two people is a smile.</p><br><br>

		<p>For 58 years, the IHOP family restaurant chain has served our world famous pancakes and a wide variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner items that are loved by people of all ages Ã¢â‚¬â€ offering an affordable, everyday dining experience with warm and friendly service.
